Paper Abstract:
In this demo, we present PressyCube, an embeddable pressure sensor that allows collecting physical force data from different types of exercises and body parts via Bluetooth for home-based rehabilitation. Currently, most home-based rehabilitation devices are focused on one specific body part only. Thus, we designed the pressure sensor that can be embedded with other props to extend its applications. We also demonstrate our work for fulfilling varying rehabilitation needs in the virtual environment with a head-mounted display by a swimming simulation exergame for players to work out using different exercises.
