Paper Abstract:
Boxing is a combat sport that involves fierce movement and close body contact between two boxers. In addition to the boxer, the coach is also essential for training. The coach could be injured or too tired to continue consecutive training sessions for many boxers. Thus, we present MovableBag, a substitutional robot that provides room-scale mobility and the ability to carry sport props with an easier tracking setup to simulate the boxing opponent or coach in virtual reality with encountered-type haptic feedback. In addition, we integrate our system with a wireless VR headset and develop a VR boxing application to show the capacity of the device and inform future studies.
