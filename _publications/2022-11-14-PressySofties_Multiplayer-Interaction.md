Paper Abstract:
Squeeze interaction is an action that utilizes different body parts to move closer to an anchor of the object, which can be done by any two body parts that can touch together, even multiplayer pressing the object together. The utility of this interaction could be adopted for exergame or rehabilitation, in which the characteristics of softness and flexibility make it safer for the child and the elder. However, previous works focus on the scenario of single users with multi-objects. Although those works can apply to multi-users, the exploration between the users is lacking for discussion. To show the feasibility, we present PressySofties, the connectable bricks for multiplayer squeeze interaction, which utilize conductive fiber and foam to detect the pressing actions and connections. With the combination of several objects with two kinds of softness, the players can perceive different prop-based haptic. Additionally, we apply to the games to explore the design consideration and possibilities for interaction design.
