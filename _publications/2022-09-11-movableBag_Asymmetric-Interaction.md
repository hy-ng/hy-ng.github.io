Paper Abstract:
Previous research shows that virtual reality (VR) exergames motivate usersâ€™ physical activity with immersion and enjoyment. However, it limits the movement for players to perform intense exercises in a small space with a complex tracking setup. In addition, asymmetric interaction of multi-user exergame in the same physical space is also lacking in the discussion in extended reality (XR). So, we present MovableBag, a substitutional robot that can be adapted to multi-user exergames with prop. It also serves as an agent to allow users from the physical world to interact with the VR user to become an XR application. Additionally, a preliminary study has been conducted, and a multi-user boxing exergame is designed to investigate the usage of the work. It also informs future design for more use cases in XR for asymmetric interaction between VR and non-VR users.
